      "This was the very first recipe I ever made by myself. I was about 11 years old. Yes I have been cooking pretty much my whole life, remember this picture? You can read about it here. Anyways, I was an interesting child. Normal children ask for toys for Christmas. Not me. I asked for a Mixer. Yeah, like a kitchen aid. And no, I didn't actually get a Kitchen Aid, I got a cheap knock-off. But I didn't care. I was thrilled about my new mixer, and ended up making these cookies to test it out! I grew up eating these cookies, especially during Christmas time. They are basically a shortbread cookie, and they are delicious! I actually made this dough a while back and froze some cookie dough to see if they would turn out. It turns out that it freezes great, and I just had to cook them a little bit longer and they were just as delicious! PS: I still don't own a Kitchen Aid mixer. These are my all time favorite cookie! They're a must on our Christmas platters (and any occasion that calls for cookies!) Your photo is just lovely! Yummy my favorite! Hint Hint to the hubby. These are one of my favorites!! I once got a jig saw for Christmas... i'm not sure if I wanted it or if my dad told me I wanted it!! haha! I love the plate and presentation!! Thanks for linking up to 2 Maids a Baking!\n"
